    <h2>Our Story</h2>

    <article>

      <p>The conception of Steadiwear traces back to one winter afternoon, as Mark Elias and his grandmother were having their routine 4 P.M. coffee. As she took her first sips, her tremor flared up. Her hands shook uncontrollably making her spill half the cup. Mark rushed to aid her burnt hands, shocked at how difficult daily activities could become with tremors.</p>

      <p>He decided to consult his aunt, a doctor who treats Essential Tremor. She told him the only viable solutions were medications with side-effects, an invasive surgery, or Botox injections. The lack of effective choices was appalling. As an engineer, Mark began brainstorming for solutions, leading to the ideation the Steadiglove.</p>

      <p>Subsequently, he proposed the concept to his friend, Emile Maamary, who had first-hand experience with Essential Tremor since his close friend and former roommate had suffered from the disorder since he was a mere teenager.</p>

      <p>As a team they joined the University of Toronto's renowned Impact Centre and have attended several support groups across Ontario with high hopes of improving the lives of anyone with hand tremors and developing the result needed & deserved.</p>
