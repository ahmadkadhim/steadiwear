    <h2>Our Story</h2>

    <article>
      
      <p>The conception of Steadiwear traces back to one winter afternoon, as Mark Elias and his grandmother were having their routine 4 P.M. coffee. As she took her first sips, her tremor flared up, her hands shook and she suddenly spilled half the cup. Mark rushed to begin tending to her burned hands, shocked at how difficult it was to accomplish basic tasks with her tremor.

      <p>He decided to consult with his aunt, a doctor who treats Essential Tremor patients. He simply asked "What can be done about this?" Her response was: “Well, there’s an invasive surgery, a couple of medications with harmful side-effects, or lastly, Botox injections”. This was objectionable, to say the least.</p>

      <p>As an engineer, Mark began brainstorming solutions in the wearable device field, which led to the birth of the Steadiglove.</p>

      <p>It was then that Mark proposed this project to his close friend, Emile Maamary, who was eager to team up with Mark. Emile had also observed his old roommate &amp; friend suffer from the disease at a young age of twenty-three years old. They have since joined the University of Toronto's renowned Impact Centre. Mark and Emile have worked tirelessly to bring the Steadiglove to market, with high hopes of improving the lives of anyone with hand tremors and getting them back to steady.</p>
